# Day 13 Session Plan: Getting What You Need Without Being Bossy

**Project Management Internship – PearlThoughts**  
**Date:** February 26, 2026  
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Presenter:** [Your Name]  
**Goal:** Help interns influence teams and clients without authority

---

## 1. Session Start (3 minutes)

**Say this exactly:**

"PMs have **no direct power** over developers, designers, or clients. You can't say 'Do this now!'

Today you'll learn how to **get people to help you** by:

1. **Talking to different teams** (developers, marketing, sales)
    
2. **Getting agreement** when everyone wants different things
    

We'll use Schedula examples - imagine launch is 2 weeks away."

---

## 2. Talking to 5 Different Teams (20 minutes)

## 2.1 PMs Are Translators

**Explain like this:**

"Imagine you're in the middle. 5 people talking to you at once:

- **Developers:** 'We found a bug in payments'
    
- **Client:** 'When will booking be ready?'
    
- **Marketing:** 'We need demo screenshots today!'
    
- **Support:** 'This design confuses customers'
    
- **Sales:** 'Client wants WhatsApp NOW'
    

Your job: **Translate** so everyone understands each other."

## 2.2 Schedula Example - Launch Week

**Show this conversation:**

text

`Monday 10 AM: Marketing: "Press release needs screenshots by 2 PM!" Sales: "Client demo tomorrow - everything must work!" Tech: "Payment bug blocks all testing" Support: "No training docs for receptionists" You (PM): ?`

**What YOU say (copy this script):**

text

`"Okay team, 2-minute sync: BIG PICTURE: Client demo tomorrow = most important PRIORITY 1: Tech - fix payment bug first (blocks everything) PRIORITY 2: Support - send me training doc draft by 12 PM PRIORITY 3: Marketing - use current screenshots, I'll get new ones after bug fix PRIORITY 4: Sales - demo will have booking + calendar (no payments yet) Everyone clear on their #1 task for next 2 hours?`

**Why this works:** One clear priority list. Everyone knows exactly what to do.

## 3. Getting Agreement When Everyone Wants Different Things (20 minutes)

## 3.1 The Problem

**Everyone pulls in different directions:**

text

`Marketing: "Launch March 15!" Tech: "Not possible till March 25" Client: "I want WhatsApp too!" Budget: "No extra money" You: ?`

## 3.2 Simple 4-Step Method (No Fancy Words)

**Step 1: Ask What They Want**  
"What is most important for your goal?"

**Step 2: Explain Limits (Use Numbers)**  
"March 15 means only booking + calendar. WhatsApp adds 2 weeks."

**Step 3: Give 3 Choices**

text

`Choice A: March 15 (basic features) Choice B: March 25 (full features) Choice C: March 15 basic + WhatsApp later`

**Step 4: Let Them Pick**  
"Which choice works best for you?"

## 3.3 Schedula Examples

**Example 1: Marketing Launch Date**

text

`Marketing: "March 15 launch!" You: "What if March 15 has booking + calendar only?" Marketing: "OK, but can we announce 'full launch coming soon'?" Deal made.`

**Example 2: Client Wants Extra Feature**

text

`Client: "Add WhatsApp!" You: "WhatsApp takes 10 days. Launch is 6 days away." Choices: 1. WhatsApp now → launch delayed 4 days 2. WhatsApp next month → launch on time 3. Skip monthly reports → add WhatsApp on time Client picks #2.`

## 4. Quick Practice (12 minutes)

**Scenario: Schedula Launch Fight**

text

`Sales: "Client demo tomorrow - full features!" Marketing: "Blog post needs screenshots TODAY!" Tech: "Database fix blocks everything till 6 PM!" Support: "No receptionist training!"`

**Interns write (5 minutes):**

1. **Your first sentence** (calm the group)
    
2. **Priority list** (1 = most urgent, 4 = least urgent)
    
3. **What you tell each person**
    

**Example answer:**

text

`1. "Team - 2 minutes to get aligned for client demo." 2. Priority:    1. Tech database fix   2. Sales demo prep   3. Support training   4. Marketing screenshots 3. Tell Tech: "Database first - blocks everything"    Tell Sales: "Demo booking + calendar only"   Tell Support: "Send training draft by 2 PM"   Tell Marketing: "Use old screenshots today"`

## 5. Your Real Job (2 minutes)

**Jira Task: SCH-95 "Schedula Priority List"**

**Due:** Tomorrow

**Task (20 minutes):**

text

`1. Open Schedula Sprint 3 board 2. List top 5 tasks for this week 3. Rank 1-5 (most urgent first) 4. For each: Who owns? When done? 5. Post your priority list in Slack`

**Why this helps:** PMs spend 50% of time getting agreement on "what matters most."

---

## 6. Wrap-Up (1 minute)

**You learned:**

text

`✅ Talk to 5 teams daily (translate, don't repeat) ✅ 4-step agreement method (ask → limits → choices → pick) ✅ Priority lists solve 80% of PM problems ✅ Real Schedula priority job`

**Tomorrow:** Data dashboards (numbers tell the truth)
