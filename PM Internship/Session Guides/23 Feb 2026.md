## Risk & Compliance in Real Projects (Security, Privacy, Uptime, SLAs)

**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Goal:** Help interns understand how “non-functional” things (security, privacy, uptime) change scope, timelines, and design for a project like Schedula.readylogic+1

## 1. Warm-up: “It’s just a calendar app… right?” (5 min)

Ask:  
“If Schedula is ‘just’ a salon calendar app, what could really go wrong?”

Collect answers, then add:

- Leaked customer phone numbers
    
- Appointment history exposed
    
- Salon revenue data leaked
    
- App down on festival days (peak traffic)
    

Key idea: Even simple apps carry **sensitive data**, so PMs must think beyond features.cbtnuggets+1

---

## 2. Security & Privacy Basics for PMs (15 min)

Explain three core ideas (no jargon):readylogic+1

- **Confidentiality:** Only the right people can see the data (e.g., only the salon sees full customer details).
    
- **Integrity:** Data is correct and not tampered with (appointments not randomly changing).
    
- **Availability:** System is up and usable when needed (no downtime on weekends).
    

Practical Schedula examples:

- Confidentiality: Role-based access (receptionist can see bookings, not full financial reports).[[readylogic](https://readylogic.co/security-and-compliance-in-project-management/)]​
    
- Integrity: No one can edit past appointments without an audit trail.
    
- Availability: If Schedula is down Saturdays 6–9 PM, salon loses most bookings.
    

Explain **privacy vs security** in simple terms:

- Security = lock on the door.
    
- Privacy = deciding what you keep in the room and who you invite in.
    

Data protection examples for Schedula:

- Store only necessary fields (phone, not Aadhaar) – data minimization.[[readylogic](https://readylogic.co/security-and-compliance-in-project-management/)]​
    
- Don’t show full phone numbers in public screens.
    
- Clear policy on how long data is stored.

## 3. Uptime & SLAs – Promises You Can’t Break (15 min)

Explain SLA in one line:

> “An SLA is a promise (often in a contract) about **how good and how fast** your service will be.”atlassian+2

Common SLA elements in plain language:

- **Uptime:** e.g., “99.5% up-time per month.”threatngsecurity+1
    
- **Response time:** e.g., “We respond to critical issues within 1 hour.”intigriti+1
    
- **Resolution time:** e.g., “We fix critical issues within 4 hours.”seconize+1
    
- **Penalties:** credits/discounts if you don’t meet the promise.cio+1
    

Schedula example:

- If you sign “99.9% uptime” with salons, you **must** think about:
    
    - Cloud region, backups, monitoring, on-call support.
        
    - More scope → more budget → more time.
        

Ask:  
“If we move SLA from 98% uptime to 99.9%, how does that change:

- Scope?
    
- Cost?
    
- Team (e.g., need on-call rotation)?”
    

Make clear: PM doesn’t design the servers, but must understand that **tighter SLAs = more work and cost**.cio+2

## 4. How Risk & Compliance Change the Project (15 min)

Give 3 concrete Schedula stories and how they change:

1. **Simple story:** “As a salon owner, I want to see all appointments of the day.”
    
    - Basic build: just show list.
        
    - With security: add role checks, log access, maybe IP restrictions.[[readylogic](https://readylogic.co/security-and-compliance-in-project-management/)]​
        
2. **Customer data story:** “As a customer, I want my data deleted if I stop using the salon.”
    
    - Introduces: delete flows, legal retention rules, data export.[[readylogic](https://readylogic.co/security-and-compliance-in-project-management/)]​
        
3. **Uptime-sensitive story:** “As a salon owner, I want Schedula always available on weekends.”
    
    - Introduces: monitoring, alerts, maybe active–passive setup.
        

Ask them:

- “Which of these three stories will be **more expensive and slower** to deliver, and why?”

## 5. Quick Exercise: Data Protection for Schedula (10 min)

Scenario:

“Schedula stores:

- Customer name, phone, email, services booked
    
- Appointment date/time
    
- Notes: e.g., ‘VIP client, offer discount’; ‘Allergic to product X’”
    

Ask interns in 2–3 lines each:

1. **Which fields are most sensitive and why?**
    
2. **One design change** to better protect this data (e.g., hide detailed notes from everyone except senior staff, encrypt sensitive fields, allow customers to see/edit/delete their info).[[readylogic](https://readylogic.co/security-and-compliance-in-project-management/)]​
    

You can close with:

> “Good PMs don’t just ship features; they protect people’s data and trust.”

## Day Y: Personal Productivity for PMs (Kanban, Calendar, Decision Logs)

**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Goal:** Teach interns how to stay sane and effective when PM work comes from all directions.teachingagile+1

---

## 1. Reality Check: Why PMs Burn Out (5 min)

Describe PM life:

- Messages from devs, clients, QA, sales – all at once.
    
- Meetings + docs + Jira + follow-ups.
    
- Easy to feel busy but not effective.
    

Tell them:

> “If you can’t manage **your own work**, you can’t manage a project.”

---

## 2. Personal Kanban Board – Your External Brain (20 min)

Introduce **Personal Kanban**:wrike+2

Two rules:

1. **Visualize your work** – put all tasks on a board (physical or digital).
    
2. **Limit Work In Progress (WIP)** – don’t juggle 10 things at once.
    

Simple 3-column board:

- **Backlog** – everything you could do.
    
- **Doing** – max 2–3 items only.freekanbanboards+2
    
- **Done** – finished work.
    

Schedula intern example cards:

- “Review SCH-60 change request draft.”
    
- “Prepare questions for tomorrow’s demo.”
    
- “Summarize standup notes for mentor.”
    

Show how this helps:

- You see overload coming.
    
- You can say “I’m already at WIP limit; which task should I drop?” – great conversation with your manager.productive+1
    

Mini-exercise (5 min):

- Ask them to list 5–7 tasks on paper.
    
- Tell them to pick **max 3** for “Doing” today and justify why.

## 3. Calendar Blocking: Protecting Focus Time (15 min)

Explain:

> “If you don’t control your calendar, everyone else will.”

Teach simple calendar blocks:

- **Focus blocks:** 60–90 minutes for deep work (e.g., writing crisis report).
    
- **Admin blocks:** 30 minutes for email, Slack, approvals.
    
- **Buffer blocks:** 15 minutes between meetings to update notes.
    

How to use with Personal Kanban:teachingagile+2

- Pick 2 tasks from “Doing”.
    
- Create calendar events: “Work on [Task]”.
    
- During that block: no multitasking, no new tasks.
    

Schedula example:

- 10:00–11:00 – “Draft Schedula Sprint 3 change request.”
    
- 3:00–3:30 – “Reply to Jira comments + Slack.”
    

Ask them:

> “If you could protect just ONE 60-min deep-work block each day, what would you use it for?”

---

## 4. Note-Taking & Decision Logs (10 min)

Explain why PM memory is a bad single source of truth:

> “Three weeks later, no one remembers who agreed to what in which meeting.”

Teach a tiny **decision log**:

- Tool: Notion/Confluence/Google Doc.
    
- Columns: Date | Decision | Who decided | Why | Impact.
    

Schedula examples:

- “Feb 10 – WhatsApp moved to Phase 2 – Client + PM – To keep MVP launch date.”
    
- “Feb 15 – Payment integration postponed – Tech risk too high before launch.”
    

Benefits:

- Stops re-arguing old decisions.
    
- Great material for your final portfolio.
    

Also suggest a **meeting note template**:

- Purpose
    
- Key points
    
- Decisions
    
- Action items (who, what, by when)

## 5. Avoiding Burnout as “Person in the Middle” (10 min)

Discuss common burnout patterns:

- Saying yes to everything.
    
- Being available 24/7 in Slack/WhatsApp.
    
- Never blocking focus time.
    
- No separation between work and study/personal life.
    

Introduce 4 simple boundaries:

1. **Response windows:** e.g., “I check Slack deeply 3 times a day.”
    
2. **End-of-day shutdown:** last 10–15 min to update board, plan tomorrow.
    
3. **No-meeting blocks:** e.g., 10–11 AM is always focus time.
    
4. **Escalation, not absorption:** if something really big breaks, escalate instead of trying to carry it alone.
    

Ask them to write:

- One boundary they can start this week (e.g., “No checking WhatsApp work groups after 9 PM”).
