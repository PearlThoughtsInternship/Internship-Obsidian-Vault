# Day 11 Session Plan: Daily Standups & Sprint Ceremonies

**Project Management Internship – PearlThoughts**  
**Date:** February 23, 2026 (Monday - Week 3 starts)  
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Presenter:** [Your Name]  
**Focus:** Running Effective Ceremonies

---

## 1. Session Overview (3 minutes)

**Read aloud:**

"Welcome to Week 3! First two weeks you learned planning. Now you learn **execution**.

Today: How to run the **daily rituals** that keep projects moving:

1. **Daily standups** - 15-minute team sync
    
2. **Sprint ceremonies** - The 4 Scrum meetings
    
3. **Your turn** - You'll facilitate a real standup
    

All PMs do this every single day. Learn it today, use it forever."

---

## 2. Daily Standups: The 15-Minute Sync (20 minutes)

## 2.1 The 3 Questions (Every Person Answers)

text

`1. What did I complete yesterday? 2. What will I work on today? 3. What blockers do I have?`

**That's it. Nothing else.**

---

## 2.2 Standup Rules

**Show these rules:**

text

`✅ DO: - Stand up (keeps energy high, meeting short) - Start on time (even if people are late) - Walk the board right-to-left (Done → In Progress → To Do) - Focus on blockers (solving problems) - Park side discussions ("Let's talk after") - End in 15 minutes MAX ❌ DON'T: - Sit down (meetings get long) - Wait for latecomers (rewards bad behavior) - Discuss solutions (standup finds problems, doesn't solve them) - Give status reports to PM (team talks to each other, not PM) - Go past 15 minutes (respect everyone's time)`

---

## 2.3 Schedula Standup Example (Watch This)

**Read this standup simulation:**

text

`PM: "Good morning team, 9 AM standup. We have 15 minutes. Let's walk the board." [Looks at 'In Progress' column on Jira] PM: "Sarah, you're working on 'Booking form validation'. Updates?" Sarah (Dev): "Yesterday finished email validation. Today doing phone number validation. No blockers." PM: "Great. Mike?" Mike (Designer): "Yesterday completed calendar mockups. Today starting SMS reminder designs. Blocker: Need client logo in high resolution." PM: "Got it, I'll get logo by noon. Priya?" Priya (QA): "Yesterday tested login flow, found 2 bugs, logged in Jira. Today testing booking flow. Blocker: staging environment is down." PM: "Critical blocker. I'll escalate to DevOps right after this meeting. Anyone else blocked by staging?" [2 hands raise] PM: "Okay, staging is top priority. I'll update you by 10 AM. Anything else urgent?" [Silence] PM: "Good. Standup done - 12 minutes. Mike, let's talk about logo after this. Priya, let me get staging fixed first, then we'll discuss your testing plan. Everyone else, back to work." [Meeting ends]`

**Key points:**

- PM facilitated, didn't dominate
    
- Blockers surfaced immediately
    
- Side conversations parked
    
- Under 15 minutes
    
- Clear action items

## 2.4 Your First Facilitation Practice (10 min)

**Instructions:**

"Now YOU run a standup. We'll do 3 rounds."

**Setup:**

- Pick 3 interns as "team members"
    
- Give them Schedula task cards (print or show on screen)
    
- Intern facilitates 3-minute standup
    
- Group gives feedback
    

**Feedback checklist:**

text

`☐ Started on time? ☐ Asked the 3 questions? ☐ Kept it under 3 minutes? ☐ Identified blockers clearly? ☐ Parked side discussions?`

**Rotate 2-3 times so multiple interns practice.**

---

## 3. The 4 Sprint Ceremonies (15 minutes)

## 3.1 Overview

**Show this timeline:**

text

`SPRINT 1 (2 weeks) │ ├─ Day 1: Sprint Planning (2 hours) │   └─ What: Pick work for sprint, estimate, commit │ ├─ Day 1-10: Daily Standup (15 min each day) │   └─ What: Sync progress, surface blockers │ ├─ Day 10: Sprint Review/Demo (1 hour) │   └─ What: Show work to stakeholders, get feedback │ └─ Day 10: Sprint Retrospective (1 hour)     └─ What: Team reflects, improves process`

---

## 3.2 Sprint Planning (You did this Day 5)

**Quick recap:**

- Team picks stories for next sprint
    
- Estimates work (story points/hours)
    
- Commits to sprint goal
    
- Identifies risks
    

**Schedula example:** "Sprint 3 goal = Customer can book and receive SMS confirmation"

---

## 3.3 Sprint Review/Demo (You'll learn Day 13)

**What happens:**

- PM shows completed work to client/stakeholders
    
- Live demo of features
    
- Collect feedback
    
- Decide what to do next sprint
    

**NOT a status meeting** - must show working software

---

## 3.4 Sprint Retrospective

**The most important ceremony** (improves team)

**3 questions team answers:**

text

`1. What went well? (Start doing) 2. What didn't go well? (Stop doing) 3. What should we keep doing? (Continue)`

**Schedula Sprint 1 Retrospective Example:**

text

`START: - Pair programming on complex tasks (faster, fewer bugs) - Sharing Figma designs 1 day before coding starts STOP: - Waiting 2 days for client email responses (now we call if urgent) - Accepting stories without acceptance criteria CONTINUE: - Daily standups at 9 AM (team likes consistency) - Friday demos to client (builds trust)`

**Action items:** Pick 1-2 things to change next sprint

---

## 4. PM's Role in Ceremonies (8 minutes)

**PM is the facilitator, not the boss.**

## What PM Does:

**In Standup:**

- Starts meeting on time
    
- Asks the 3 questions
    
- Writes down blockers
    
- Ends on time
    
- **Solves blockers after standup** (not during)
    

**In Sprint Planning:**

- Presents business priorities
    
- Helps estimate difficult stories
    
- Confirms sprint goal
    
- Documents plan in Jira
    

**In Demo:**

- Presents to client/stakeholders
    
- Shows completed work
    
- Collects feedback
    
- Updates backlog based on feedback
    

**In Retrospective:**

- Creates safe space (no blame)
    
- Ensures everyone speaks
    
- Writes down feedback
    
- **Most important:** Actually implements 1-2 improvements next sprint

## 5. Common Mistakes to Avoid (5 minutes)

**Show these anti-patterns:**

❌ **Standup becomes status report to PM**

- Team talks to PM instead of each other
    
- Fix: PM asks "Who needs help?" not "What did you do?"
    

❌ **Solutions discussed in standup**

- Dev explains bug fix for 10 minutes
    
- Fix: "Let's talk after standup"
    

❌ **Standups happen at random times**

- Some days 9 AM, some days 11 AM
    
- Fix: Same time every day, no exceptions
    

❌ **Retrospective has no action items**

- Team complains, nothing changes
    
- Fix: Pick 1-2 concrete changes, assign owners
    

❌ **Demo shows half-working features**

- "This will work once we fix this bug..."
    
- Fix: Only show DONE work, be honest about what's not ready

## 6. Your Practice Assignment (6 minutes)

**Jira Task: SCH-90 "Facilitate Mini Retrospective"**

**Task (Due Wednesday):**

Imagine Schedula Sprint 2 just finished. Based on everything you've learned:

1. Write a **Start/Stop/Continue** retrospective board
    
2. For each column, write 1-2 specific items (not vague)
    
3. Pick **1 action item** to implement in Sprint 3
    
4. Explain why that action item will improve the team
    

**Format:**

text

`START: - [Specific thing to start doing] STOP: - [Specific thing to stop doing] CONTINUE: - [Specific thing working well] ACTION ITEM FOR SPRINT 3: - [What will change] - [Why this helps] - [Who owns it]`

**Submit in Confluence** (template provided)

---

## 7. Wrap-Up (3 minutes)

**What you learned:**

✅ **Daily standup** = 15 min, 3 questions, focus on blockers  
✅ **4 Sprint ceremonies** = Planning, Standup, Review, Retrospective  
✅ **PM role** = Facilitate, don't dominate  
✅ **You practiced** = Facilitated real standup

**Key insight:**

"Ceremonies aren't bureaucracy. They're the rhythm that keeps teams synchronized. Skip them and projects drift. Do them well and teams self-organize."

**Tomorrow (Day 12):** Burndown charts - how to know if sprint is on track

## Presenter Notes

**Make this session interactive:**

- Actual standup simulation with 3+ interns
    
- Give feedback immediately (what worked, what didn't)
    
- Let them feel the awkwardness of silence, going over time, etc.
    
- Emphasize: These ceremonies happen **every single sprint** - learn once, use forever
    

**Common intern mistakes to watch:**

- Talking too much as facilitator
    
- Not tracking time
    
- Letting side discussions continue
    
- Not writing down blockers
    

This is hands-on practice - they should leave feeling "I can run a standup tomorrow."
