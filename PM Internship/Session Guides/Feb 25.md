## 1. Session Kickoff (3 minutes)

"Yesterday we learned how to **handle difficult clients**. Today we learn how to **prevent those situations** by running great meetings.

We'll cover:

1. **Discovery workshops** - Getting clear requirements at project start
    
2. **Requirement sessions** - Refining scope mid-project
    
3. **Facilitation techniques** - Keeping groups productive
    
4. **Your first workshop** - Live Schedula feature prioritization
    

Great PMs don't just react to problems; they **prevent confusion** through structured conversations."

## 2. Why Workshops Replace Endless Emails (10 minutes)

## 2.1 The Problem with Email/Async Communication

**Show this scenario:**

text

`Email Chain (Day 1): "What features for Schedula?" Reply (Day 2): "Booking, calendar, reminders" Reply (Day 3): "Also payments?" Reply (Day 4): "What about staff scheduling?" Reply (Day 5): "Monthly reports too?" Result: 5 days wasted, still no clarity.`

**Workshop Advantage:**

`1-hour meeting → Clear priority list → Everyone aligned → Move fast`

## 2.2 When to Run Workshops

**3 situations:**

1. **Project kickoff** - "What are we building?"
    
2. **Mid-project scope review** - "What stays, what goes?"
    
3. **Problem-solving** - "Why are we late? How to fix?"
    

**Schedula Example:** Week 2 workshop decided:

- **Must:** Booking, Calendar, SMS reminders
    
- **Should:** Staff scheduling
    
- **Could:** Monthly reports
    
- **Won't:** Payments, Google sync (Phase 2)
