# Day 11 Session Plan: Client Mastery & Meeting Facilitation

**Project Management Internship – PearlThoughts**  
**Date:** February 24, 2026  
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Presenter:** [Your Name]  
**Level:** Advanced Client & Facilitation Skills

---

## 1. Session Kickoff - Why This Matters (5 minutes)

**Read this exactly:**

"Today you're learning **two skills that make you indispensable**:

1. **Handling Difficult Clients** - Every PM faces angry clients; how you handle them determines your career
    
2. **Meeting Facilitation** - Most PMs waste time in bad meetings; great PMs run meetings that create clarity
    

These are the skills that get you promoted from 'task-doer' to 'trusted advisor'. Companies value PMs who can manage people _outside_ their team."

**Schedula Context:** "We're in Week 7 of 10. Client just raised 3 new feature requests and threatened to 'look at other vendors' if we don't deliver everything by launch."

## 2. Handling Difficult Clients & Escalations (25 minutes)

## 2.1 The 4 Types of "Difficult" Clients

**Show this table:**

|Client Type|Behavior|Example|PM Strategy|
|---|---|---|---|
|**The Demander**|"I need this YESTERDAY!"|"Add WhatsApp NOW or we're switching vendors"|**Slow down, gather facts**|
|**The Scope Creep**|"Just one more small thing..."|"Also add coupons, also Google sync..."|**Iron Triangle + options**|
|**The Radio Silent**|Never replies to emails|No feedback on designs for 10 days|**Escalation + alternatives**|
|**The Micromanager**|Questions every decision|"Why did you choose blue? Why 30min slots?"|**Pre-emptive communication**|

## 2.2 De-escalation Language: What to Say vs Avoid

**Read these aloud (practice together):**

**What TO Say:**

text

`"I understand this is urgent for your business..." "Let's take 5 minutes to understand the impact..." "Here are 3 options to solve this..." "What is the business outcome you're trying to achieve?" "I'll get back to you by [specific time] with options."`

**What NOT to Say:**

text

`"Calm down" (makes it worse) "That's impossible" (shuts down conversation) "We'll try our best" (false hope) "That's not in scope" (sounds defensive)`

## 2.3 The Escalation Path (When to Call Your Boss)

**Clear rule:**

text

`You OWN decisions up to ₹50K / 2-day delay ESCALATE anything bigger`

**Escalation template (copy this):**

text

`SUBJECT: [Client Name] Escalation - [Issue Summary] BACKGROUND: [2 sentences] IMPACT: [Timeline/Budget/Quality risk] WHAT I'VE DONE: [Your attempts to resolve] NEXT STEPS NEEDED: [What you need from leadership]`

**Schedula Example:**

text

`SUBJECT: Salon Owner Escalation - WhatsApp Feature BACKGROUND: Client demands WhatsApp integration before launch (6 days away) IMPACT: +2 weeks delay OR +₹1.5L cost OR remove 2 existing features WHAT I'VE DONE: Offered 3 options, client insists "all or nothing" NEXT STEPS NEEDED: Decision from leadership on commercial priority`

## 3. Workshop & Meeting Facilitation (25 minutes)

## 3.1 Why Most Meetings Fail (and How to Fix Them)

**3 common problems:**

1. **No agenda** → 30 min wasted on "what are we doing?"
    
2. **No time discipline** → 1-hour meeting becomes 90 minutes
    
3. **No decisions** → "Let's discuss offline" (never happens)
    

## 3.2 The 7-Minute Meeting Framework

**Template to use every time:**

text

`1 MIN: Agenda + Objectives (write on whiteboard/chat) "Today we will decide [specific outcome]" 2 MIN: Discussion (time-boxed) "Everyone gets 30 seconds to share their view" 2 MIN: Options (if needed) "Here are 2 options. Which do you prefer?" 2 MIN: Decision "Decision: [clear outcome]. Who owns next steps?"`

## 3.3 Simple Facilitation Activities (Schedula Examples)

**Activity 1: Silent Brainstorming (5 min)**

text

`Instructions: "Write 1 idea per sticky note. No talking for 3 minutes." Use case: "What features should Schedula have?"`

**Activity 2: Dot Voting (3 min)**

text

`Instructions: "Each person gets 3 dots. Put dots on your top 3 ideas." Use case: Prioritize 10 feature ideas down to top 3`

**Activity 3: 5-5-5 Prioritization (5 min)**

text

`Instructions: "5 min discussion → 5 min voting → 5 min decide." Use case: "Which 3 features MUST be in MVP?"`

**Activity 4: Parking Lot**

text

`Instructions: "Off-topic? Write on Parking Lot sticky. Discuss after main agenda." Prevents derailment.`

## 4. LIVE Exercise: Difficult Client Role-Play (10 minutes)

**Scenario: The WhatsApp Ultimatum**

**You play client (angry salon owner):**

> "Look, I pay you ₹8 lakhs. My competitors have WhatsApp booking. My customers are asking for it every day. If you can't add it before launch, I'll find someone who can. This is not optional."

**Interns (in chat, 30 seconds each):**

1. **First response** (de-escalation language)
    
2. **Next step** (what you do immediately after)
    
3. **Escalation decision** (escalate or not? Why?)
    

**Pick 2-3 responses to read aloud and give feedback.**

**Your model response:**

text

`"Thank you for being direct - I understand WhatsApp is important for your business. Let me assess impact quickly: - Development: 10 days - Testing: 3 days   - Total: 2 weeks delay to launch Options: 1. Add WhatsApp, delay launch 2 weeks 2. Launch on time, add WhatsApp Phase 2 (Month 2) 3. Add WhatsApp, remove Monthly Reports feature Which option best fits your launch goals? I'll confirm with leadership and get back to you by 2 PM today."`

## 5. Real Assignment: Client Escalation Document (2 minutes)

**Jira Task: SCH-90 "Client Escalation Prep"**

**Due:** Tomorrow EOD (30 minutes work)

**Deliverable:**  
Pick **one difficult client scenario** from today (Demander, Scope Creep, Radio Silent, or Micromanager).

Write:

1. **Escalation Email** to your PM lead (use template above)
    
2. **De-escalation Script** (what you say to client first)
    
3. **Meeting Agenda** (7-minute framework for follow-up)
    

**Template provided in Confluence: "Client Escalation Pack".**

**Why this matters:** Senior PMs delegate escalations to juniors who handle them well. This builds trust fast.
