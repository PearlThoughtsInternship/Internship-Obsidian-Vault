# Day 10: Change Management & Scope Control

**Project Management Internship – PearlThoughts**  
**Date:** February 19, 2026  
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Presenter:** [Your Name]  
**Focus:** Managing Change Requests & Preventing Scope Creep

---

## 📋 Session Overview

> [!info] Today's Learning Objectives
> - Understand what scope creep is and how it silently destroys projects
> - Master the 5-step change control process used by professional PMs
> - Learn to present trade-offs using the Iron Triangle framework
> - Practice saying "No" professionally using data and options
> - Apply change management to real Schedula scenarios

**Why This Matters:** Uncontrolled scope creep is the **#2 reason projects fail** (after poor estimation). This session teaches you how to protect project scope while keeping stakeholders happy[1][2].

## 🎯 Part 1: Understanding Scope Creep (10 minutes)

### What is Scope Creep?

**Definition:** The uncontrolled expansion of project scope without adjustments to time, cost, or resources.

## How Scope Creep Happens (Schedula Examples)

|Week|Request|Sounds Harmless?|Actual Impact|
|---|---|---|---|
|2|"Can the button be blue instead of green?"|✓ Yes|15 min change|
|3|"Can we add customer photos?"|✓ Yes|+8 hours (storage, upload, display)|
|4|"Can customers book via WhatsApp?"|✓ Yes|+40 hours (new integration)|
|5|"Can we add loyalty points system?"|✓ Yes|+80 hours (new database, logic, UI)|

**Cumulative Impact:** +128 hours = **3+ weeks delay** from "small requests"

> [!warning] The Silent Killer  
> Scope creep doesn't announce itself. It accumulates through:
> 
> - "Quick changes" that compound
>     
> - "While you're at it" additions
>     
> - Ambiguous requirements interpreted broadly
>     
> - Gold-plating (team adding unrequested features)
>

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

## **Step 1: Log the Request**

Create formal record immediately:

text

`## Change Request #CR-012 **Date:** 2026-02-19 **Requestor:** Salon Owner (Client) **Request:** "Add WhatsApp booking integration" **Priority:** High (per client) **Status:** Under Review`

## **Step 2: Impact Assessment**

Analyze using three dimensions:

text

`graph TD   A[Change Request:<br/>WhatsApp Integration] --> B[Scope Impact]  A --> C[Time Impact]  A --> D[Cost Impact]  B --> B1[+5 story points<br/>New API integration<br/>New UI screens]  C --> C1[+1 week dev<br/>+3 days testing<br/>Delays launch]  D --> D1[+₹25,000 dev<br/>+₹5,000 WhatsApp API<br/>Monthly costs]  style A fill:#4ECDC4  style B fill:#FFE66D  style C fill:#FF6B6B  style D fill:#95E1D3`

**Schedula WhatsApp Integration Analysis:**

|Dimension|Current Plan|With Change|Delta|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Scope**|18 story points|23 story points|+5 pts (+28%)|
|**Timeline**|Launch Feb 28|Launch Mar 7|+7 days|
|**Cost**|₹8,00,000|₹8,30,000|+₹30,000|
|**Team Load**|At capacity|128% capacity|Overload risk|

## **Step 3: Generate Options**

Never present just "Yes" or "No". Always give **3 options**:

> [!example] Schedula WhatsApp Options
> 
> **Option A: Accept & Delay Launch**
> 
> - ✅ Client gets WhatsApp feature
>     
> - ❌ Launch delayed 1 week
>     
> - ❌ Marketing campaign timing affected
>     
> - Cost: +₹30,000
>     
> 
> **Option B: Defer to Phase 2**
> 
> - ✅ Launch on time (Feb 28)
>     
> - ✅ Budget unchanged
>     
> - ❌ No WhatsApp at launch
>     
> - ✅ Can promote "WhatsApp coming soon"
>     
> - Timeline: Add in March update
>     
> 
> **Option C: Swap Features**
> 
> - ✅ Launch on time
>     
> - Add WhatsApp, remove "Monthly Reports" feature
>     
> - Same scope (23 pts → 18 pts after removal)
>     
> - ❌ Lose analytics capability temporarily
>     

## **Step 4: Present Trade-offs (The Iron Triangle)**

Visualize the constraint relationship:

text

`graph TD   A[Good] --> B[Fast]  A --> C[Cheap]  B --> C  B -.->|Pick 2| D[High Quality<br/>+ On Time<br/>= Expensive]  A -.->|Pick 2| E[High Quality<br/>+ Cheap<br/>= Slow]  C -.->|Pick 2| F[Fast<br/>+ Cheap<br/>= Low Quality]  style A fill:#4ECDC4  style B fill:#FF6B6B  style C fill:#95E1D3`

**Present to client using this script:**

> "We can absolutely add WhatsApp booking. To maintain quality, we need to adjust either:
> 
> 1. **Timeline** – Push launch to March 7 (+1 week)
>     
> 2. **Scope** – Remove Monthly Reports feature to make room
>     
> 3. **Budget** – Add ₹30,000 for overtime development
>     
> 
> Which constraint are you most flexible on?"

## **Step 5: Document Decision**

Whatever the outcome, record it:

text

`## Change Request #CR-012 - DECISION **Date:** 2026-02-19 **Decision:** Option B - Defer to Phase 2 **Decided By:** Client Stakeholder (Salon Owner) **Rationale:** - Launch timing critical for seasonal business (wedding season) - WhatsApp nice-to-have but not blocking launch - Will promote as "Coming in March update" **Actions:** - [ ] Update roadmap with Phase 2 WhatsApp feature - [ ] Communicate decision to dev team - [ ] Add to marketing messaging: "WhatsApp integration coming soon" - [ ] Create Phase 2 epic in Jira **Communication Sent:** Yes (email to stakeholders 2026-02-19 14:30)`

## 🛡️ Part 3: Preventing Scope Creep (10 minutes)

## Prevention Strategies

text

`mindmap   root((Scope Creep<br/>Prevention))    Clear Requirements      Written user stories      Acceptance criteria      Definition of Done    Change Control Process      Formal request form      Impact assessment      Stakeholder approval    Regular Communication      Weekly status updates      Demo early and often      Manage expectations    Strong Project Charter      Defined scope boundaries      Out-of-scope items listed      Sign-off from stakeholders`

## Schedula Prevention Example

**Project Charter - Out of Scope Section:**

> [!warning] Explicitly Out of Scope for Schedula MVP
> 
> The following features are **NOT included** in initial launch:
> 
> - ❌ Payment processing (Phase 2)
>     
> - ❌ Video call consultation booking
>     
> - ❌ Multi-location salon management
>     
> - ❌ Staff payroll integration
>     
> - ❌ Customer loyalty points program
>     
> - ❌ WhatsApp/SMS booking (Phase 2)
>     
> - ❌ Google Calendar sync
>     
> - ❌ Mobile app (web-only for MVP)
>     
> 
> Any requests for these features will be evaluated for Phase 2 (Q2 2026).

## Saying "No" Professionally

**Bad PM Response:**

> "No, we can't do that. It's not in scope."

**Good PM Response:**

> "That's a great idea for improving customer engagement. Adding WhatsApp would require adjusting our timeline or scope. Let me present three options so we can make the best decision together. When would be a good time to review the trade-offs?"

## 💼 Part 4: Real Scenario Practice (20 minutes)

## Scenario 1: The "Quick Change" Request

**Context:** Schedula Sprint 2, Day 3 of 10

**Client Email Received:**

text

`Subject: Quick Design Change Hi Team, I showed the booking screen to my staff. Can you make these quick changes? 1. Move the "Cancel" button to the right side 2. Add salon logo at top of confirmation page 3. Change "Submit" to "Book My Appointment" 4. Add field for customer's Instagram handle 5. Make the calendar show 2 months instead of 1 These are small, shouldn't take long. Need by Friday for our internal demo. Thanks!`

**Your Task (10 minutes):**

Using the 5-step process:

1. **Log:** Which requests would you log as change requests vs. cosmetic changes?
    
2. **Assess:** Estimate impact of each (hours, risk)
    
3. **Options:** What 3 options would you present?
    
4. **Trade-offs:** How would you explain the Iron Triangle here?
    
5. **Recommend:** Which option would YOU recommend and why?
    

**Work Format:**

text

`## My Change Control Analysis ### Classification: - Cosmetic (can do quickly): [list] - Scope change (requires formal process): [list] ### Impact Assessment: | Request | Hours | Risk | Sprint Impact | |---------|-------|------|---------------| | 1. Button position | | | | | 2. Logo addition | | | | | 3. Button text | | | | | 4. Instagram field | | | | | 5. 2-month calendar | | | | ### Three Options: **Option A:** [Your option] **Option B:** [Your option] **Option C:** [Your option] ### My Recommendation: [Your choice + 2-3 sentence rationale]`

## Scenario 2: The Scope Creep Cascade

**Context:** Week 4 of Schedula project

**Timeline of Requests:**

text

`gantt   title Scope Creep Over Time  dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD  section Original Scope  Booking System :done, 2026-02-01, 14d  Calendar View :done, 2026-02-15, 7d  SMS Reminders :active, 2026-02-22, 7d  section Added Requests  Customer Photos :crit, 2026-02-10, 3d  WhatsApp Integration :crit, 2026-02-19, 7d  Loyalty Points :crit, 2026-02-24, 10d  Staff Scheduling :crit, 2026-02-26, 8d`

**Current Status:**

- Original scope: 18 story points
    
- Added requests: +22 story points (122% increase)
    
- Original deadline: Feb 28
    
- Current trajectory: March 15
    

**Your Task (10 minutes):**

You're the PM. The client keeps saying "just one more small thing." How do you:

1. **Communicate the problem** to the client (draft 3-4 sentence message)
    
2. **Reset expectations** without damaging relationship
    
3. **Propose path forward** (what gets delivered when?)
    

Write your response in this format:

text

`## Client Communication Draft ### Subject: Schedula Project Scope Discussion Hi [Client Name], [Your message - 4-5 sentences maximum] [Must include: current status, impact of changes, path forward, request for meeting] Best regards, [Your name] *** ### Meeting Agenda (if they accept): 1. [What you'll discuss first] 2. [Second topic] 3. [Desired outcome]`

## 📊 Part 5: Change Control Metrics (5 minutes)

## Tracking Scope Changes

Professional PMs track these numbers:

text

`pie title Schedula Change Requests - Sprint 2   "Approved & Implemented" : 2  "Approved & Deferred" : 5  "Rejected" : 1  "Under Review" : 3`

**Key Metrics:**

|Metric|Schedula Sprint 2|Industry Benchmark|Status|
|---|---|---|---|
|Change Requests Received|11|8-12 per sprint|✅ Normal|
|Approval Rate|64% (7/11)|50-70%|✅ Good|
|Scope Increase|+12%|<15%|✅ Good|
|Timeline Impact|+3 days|<5 days|✅ Acceptable|
|Budget Impact|+₹15,000|<10%|✅ Under control|

> [!success] What Good Looks Like
> 
> - Not saying "Yes" to everything (approval rate 50-70% is healthy)
>     
> - Keeping scope growth under 15%
>     
> - Every change has documented decision
>     
> - Stakeholders understand trade-offs before deciding
>

## 📚 Key Takeaways

> [!summary] Today's Core Lessons
> 
> 1. **Scope creep kills projects silently** through accumulated "small" changes
>     
> 2. **5-step change control process** is non-negotiable:
>     
>     - Log → Assess → Options → Trade-offs → Decide
>         
> 3. **Never present just Yes/No** – always give 3 options with trade-offs
>     
> 4. **Iron Triangle is your friend** – visually show that changing one dimension affects others
>     
> 5. **Saying "No" professionally** means showing data and offering alternatives
>     
> 6. **Prevention beats cure** – clear scope boundaries in project charter prevent most issues
>     
> 7. **Every change request deserves documentation** – future you (and auditors) will thank you
