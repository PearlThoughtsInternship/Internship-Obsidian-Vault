Day 12 – Workshop & Meeting Facilitation Deep Dive

Project Management Internship – PearlThoughts
Date: February 25, 2026
Duration: 60 Minutes

Session Overview

This session focused on understanding how Project Managers conduct effective workshops and requirement meetings to avoid confusion
during project execution. The main objective was to learn how structured discussions help teams align faster and reduce miscommunication.

The session emphasized that strong PMs prevent problems early by organizing clear conversations instead of reacting to issues later.

Key Learnings
1. Importance of Discovery Workshops

Discovery workshops help teams clearly define project requirements at the beginning. Instead of long email chains and delayed decisions, 
workshops allow stakeholders to align quickly within a short meeting.

Main benefits:

Faster decision making

Clear feature prioritization

Reduced misunderstandings

Better stakeholder alignment

2. Problems with Async Communication

The session demonstrated how email discussions often create delays and unclear requirements. Multiple replies over several days can still
fail to produce clarity, whereas a structured workshop can achieve alignment in one hour.

3. When Workshops Should Be Conducted

Workshops are useful in three main scenarios:

Project kickoff – defining project goals and scope

Mid-project review – refining priorities and scope

Problem-solving discussions – identifying delays and solutions

Example from the Schedula project showed how features were categorized into Must, Should, Could, and Won’t (MoSCoW prioritization).

4. 60-Minute Workshop Framework

A structured agenda was introduced to run productive sessions:

Welcome and ground rules

Context explanation

Silent brainstorming

Group discussion and sharing

Prioritization and agreement

Final summary and next steps

This structure ensures participation from all stakeholders and keeps meetings focused on outcomes.

Key Takeaway

Effective workshops reduce confusion, speed up decision-making, and help Project Managers maintain clarity throughout the project lifecycle.
