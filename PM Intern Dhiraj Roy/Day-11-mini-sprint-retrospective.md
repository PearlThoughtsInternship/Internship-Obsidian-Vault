Day 11 Assignment – Mini Sprint Retrospective

Project: Schedula
Intern: Dhiraj Roy

Sprint 2 Retrospective

After completing Sprint 2, the team discussed our overall progress and identified areas where we performed well and where improvements are needed. 
The purpose of this retrospective is to learn from our experience and make the next sprint smoother and more efficient.

START

Start defining clear acceptance criteria before development begins so that everyone understands the requirements properly.

Start reporting blockers immediately through team communication channels instead of waiting for the next standup.

STOP

Stop beginning work on tasks without complete requirement clarification, as it leads to confusion later.

Stop delaying communication between developers and QA, which caused testing delays during the sprint.

CONTINUE

Continue conducting daily standups at the same time every day because it keeps the team aligned.

Continue sharing design updates early, which helped developers understand the work better and reduced rework.

ACTION ITEM FOR SPRINT 3

Action:
Before moving any task to “In Progress”, the team will review and confirm acceptance criteria.

Why this helps:
This will reduce misunderstandings, improve testing quality, and help the team complete tasks faster without repeated corrections.

Owner:
Project Manager with support from the Development and QA team.

Conclusion

This retrospective helped the team understand both strengths and improvement areas. By applying small but practical changes, the team can work more efficiently and avoid repeated issues in future sprints.
