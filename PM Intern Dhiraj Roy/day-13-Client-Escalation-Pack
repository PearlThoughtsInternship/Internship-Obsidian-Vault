Client Escalation Pack – Assignment

Project: Schedula
Intern: Dhiraj Roy
Scenario Chosen: The Demander (Urgent Feature Request)

1. Escalation Email to PM Lead

SUBJECT: Salon Owner Escalation – WhatsApp Integration Request

BACKGROUND:
The client has requested WhatsApp booking integration to be added before the scheduled product launch. The launch date is 6 days away, 
and the client has expressed concern about continuing with the vendor if the feature is not included.

IMPACT:

Development effort: ~10 days

Testing effort: ~3 days

Total impact: Approx. 2-week delay in launch timeline

Alternative impact: Additional estimated cost of ₹1.5L or removal of existing planned features.

WHAT I’VE DONE:

Acknowledged the client’s urgency and business need.

Explained the development and timeline impact.

Presented three possible options:

Delay launch and include WhatsApp integration.

Launch on time and include WhatsApp in Phase 2.

Add WhatsApp now by removing a lower-priority feature.

The client is currently insisting on immediate implementation without timeline change.

NEXT STEPS NEEDED:
Requesting leadership guidance on commercial priority and approval on whether timeline adjustment or scope trade-off should be proposed formally to the client.

2. De-escalation Script (Client Conversation)

“Thank you for sharing this directly — I completely understand that WhatsApp booking is important for your business and customer experience.

Let me quickly walk you through the impact so we can make the best decision together. Based on our assessment, adding this feature immediately would require
additional development and testing time.

To support your goals, here are three possible options we can consider:

Launch with WhatsApp integration and adjust the timeline,

Launch as planned and add WhatsApp in Phase 2,

Or include WhatsApp now by replacing another feature.

Which option best aligns with your launch priorities? I will also review this internally and get back to you today with confirmation.”
