In this session, we learned that a project is not only about building features, but also about protecting user data, maintaining system reliability, and managing work efficiently as a Project Manager.

The first part of the session focused on risk and compliance in real projects. Even a simple application like a scheduling or calendar app can handle sensitive information such as customer details and appointment history. Because of this, PMs must think about security, privacy, and system uptime from the beginning of a project.
We discussed three important concepts — confidentiality (only the right people can access data), integrity (data should remain accurate), and availability (the system should work when users need it). The session also explained the difference between security and privacy in simple terms and how Service Level Agreements (SLAs) create commitments around uptime and response time, which directly affect project scope, cost, and timelines.

Through practical examples, we understood that adding requirements like role-based access, audit logs, data deletion requests, and high uptime expectations makes development more complex. A PM may not design the technical solution but must understand how these factors impact planning and delivery.

The second part of the session covered personal productivity for Project Managers. Since PMs handle communication from multiple teams, it is easy to feel busy but not productive. We learned how tools like a Personal Kanban board help visualize tasks and limit work in progress, while calendar blocking protects focused work time. The importance of maintaining decision logs and setting healthy work boundaries was also discussed to avoid burnout.

Key takeaway:
A good Project Manager doesn’t just deliver features — they manage risks, protect user trust, and organize their own work effectively to keep projects running smoothly.
