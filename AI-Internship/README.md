# 🧠 AI Engineering Internship  
## AI-Driven Legacy Modernization

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains documentation, research, and implementation work produced during the **AI Engineering Internship**, focused on **AI-Driven Legacy Modernization**.

The internship aims to build **intelligent AI systems that deeply understand enterprise codebases** and accelerate safe migration from legacy systems to modern architectures—without losing critical business logic.

This work goes beyond traditional static analysis or AI coding tools by emphasizing **holistic enterprise intelligence**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Enterprises rely heavily on legacy systems that are:
- Business-critical but poorly documented
- Often decades old
- Maintained by a shrinking pool of experts

### Why Legacy Modernization Fails
- Business rules exist only in code
- Manual analysis is slow and costly
- Big-bang rewrites lose hidden logic
- Existing AI tools lack semantic and runtime awareness

This internship treats modernization as a **knowledge understanding and extraction problem**, not just a code migration task.

---

## 🚀 Internship Objective

Build AI-powered tools that can:
- Understand enterprise codebases like a senior engineer
- Extract business logic and architectural intent
- Perform impact analysis across systems
- Assist safe and incremental modernization

## 🧠 Core Concept: Holistic Enterprise Intelligence

Instead of basic file or symbol indexing, the system builds a **multi-layered knowledge model**:

### Intelligence Layers
1. **Semantic Code Understanding**
   - Function/class-level chunking
   - Context-preserving embeddings

2. **Graph-Based Knowledge**
   - Call graphs
   - Dependency graphs
   - Data-flow relationships

3. **AST-Level Analysis**
   - Business rule extraction
   - Framework-specific patterns

4. **Runtime Intelligence**
   - Execution traces
   - Hot path identification
   - Error and performance patterns

5. **Enterprise Context**
   - Git history
   - Jira tickets
   - Wikis and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## 🛠️ What Is Being Built

### Code Synthesizer Tool

A developer-facing AI tool that augments AI editors by providing **deep enterprise system understanding**.

Key capabilities:
- Semantic search by intent
- Impact analysis for code changes
- Business logic discovery
- Legacy → modern parity tracking
- AI-assisted migration workflows

## 🧪 Validation Systems

The solution is validated against **real-world enterprise open-source systems**:

| System   | Domain     | Tech Stack |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Bahmni | Healthcare | Java, Spring |
| ERPNext | ERP | Python, Frappe |
| Odoo | Modular ERP | Python, PostgreSQL |

---

## 🧭 Internship Tracks

Each intern focuses on **one primary track**:

- **Track A – Knowledge Extraction**  
  Semantic chunking, call graphs, dependency graphs

- **Track B – Intelligent Retrieval**  
  RAG and GraphRAG for code understanding

- **Track C – Domain Discovery**  
  Bounded-context detection via clustering

- **Track D – Migration Automation**  
  Legacy → modern parity tracking and AI migration agents
