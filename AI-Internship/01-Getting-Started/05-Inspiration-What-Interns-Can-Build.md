## Why This Page Exists

After reading [Before You Begin](./00-Before-You-Begin.md), you might be thinking: "This is intense. Can someone like me really make an impact?"

The answer is **yes** — if you bring the right mindset. This page shares real examples of interns and junior engineers building production-critical systems. Not toy projects. Not demos. Real products used by millions.

## Companies That Trust Interns With Real Work

### 1. Juspay (India) — Payments Infrastructure

[Juspay](https://juspay.in/) handles payments for India's largest internet companies. 100M+ transactions per day at 99.999% availability.

| What Was Built | Scale | Who Built It |
|----------------|-------|--------------|
| DUI Framework (core SDK component) | **140M+ users**, 200M+ SDK installs | **An intern** |
| BHIM (India's national UPI payment app) | **10M+ users** | Developer with **<6 months experience** |

**Average creation age for key frameworks: < 24 years old.**

Their philosophy:

> *"It is your Day 0! And you will be working on production critical projects and developing proprietary frameworks."*

They invest in **Functional Programming** and **Domain-Specific Languages** — architectures that amplify talent at any experience level.

### 2. SpaceX (USA) — Aerospace

SpaceX interns don't run simulations — they work on actual **Falcon 9** and **Dragon** production.

From their internship program:

> *"Interns design, develop, test, and manufacture spaceflight technology. The work done is anything but frivolous."*

What interns work on:
- Manufacturing: assembling rocket components, quality inspection, process design
- Software: guidance systems for Falcon 9, mission control tools
- Engineering: real components that fly to space

Dragon went from a blank sheet to its first mission in just over four years. In 2012, it became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the ISS — a feat previously achieved only by governments.

### 3. Intercom (Ireland/USA) — Customer Messaging

Intercom has a famous principle:

> *"New engineers ship code on their first day and a feature in their first week."*

They achieve this through **Intermissions** — self-contained projects with small scope that let new engineers jump right in without needing to understand the entire codebase first.

This isn't sink-or-swim. It's intentional architecture that makes new contributors productive immediately.

---

### 4. Twitter/X (USA) — Social Media

From Twitter's internship program:

> *"When you log into Twitter, you'll likely see a feature shipped by one of our interns. All interns have a hand in building a product that's changing the world."*

Not hypothetical. Not internal tools. Features you actually see when you use the platform.

### 5. Razorpay (India) — Fintech

[Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/) powers digital payments for Indian businesses. Glassdoor reviews from interns describe it as:

> *"Probably the best Engineering Culture... fantastic engineering and security practices, very high coding standards, quality code pushed to production, cutting-edge tech."*

What interns receive:
- MacBook Pro + coding monitors
- Competitive stipends (₹30k/month) at par with tier 1 companies
- Real production codebases, not sandboxed projects

The engineering team treats code quality seriously — your work goes to production.

## The Common Pattern

Every company on this list shares the same philosophy:

| What They Do | What It Enables |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Trust new engineers with real problems | Ownership from day one |
| Invest in strong foundations (frameworks, DSLs, architecture) | Talent can contribute faster |
| Accept that mistakes happen | Learning through real stakes |
| Measure output, not tenure | Best ideas win regardless of source |

The question isn't *"Can interns build real things?"* — it's *"Will this intern step up when given the chance?"*

## What This Means for You

You're building code intelligence tools for legacy modernization — a **$300B+ market problem** that enterprises struggle with. This isn't a training exercise. It's research into a real problem space.

The interns at these companies didn't start knowing everything. They:

1. **Figured things out** when documentation was sparse
2. **Owned their problems** instead of waiting for instructions
3. **Delivered working systems** — not just "I tried"
4. **Built on good foundations** — frameworks, patterns, proven approaches

Sound familiar? That's exactly what we're asking of you in the [Rainforest Test](./00-Before-You-Begin.md#the-rainforest-test).

## The Confidence Equation

```
Capability = (Effort × Resourcefulness) + Good Foundations
```

You have:
- **Good foundations**: This vault, reference implementations, target codebases
- **Effort**: That's on you
- **Resourcefulness**: Also on you

Age and experience are not the limiting factors. **Initiative and execution are.**

## Ready?

Now you know what's possible. The question is: **what will you build?**
