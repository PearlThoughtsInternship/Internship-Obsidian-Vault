# Day 2 – Code Analyzer Progress

##  Intern Name
Nikita Jaiswal

##  Project
Python Code / Project Metrics Analyzer  
(Reference-based learning from `code-analyzer-demo`)

##  Objective
To understand how static code analysis tools work and build a small
learning-focused analyzer instead of a production-ready tool.

##  What I worked on today

- Explored the provided reference repository
- Understood how learning progress is shown through commits
- Built a lightweight analyzer that:
  - Scans Python files
  - Counts functions and lines of code
  - Extracts import statements
  - Flags files using simple complexity rules
- Generated structured JSON output

##  Key Learnings

- Static analysis does not require running code
- Simple metrics can already give useful insights
- Breaking the problem into small steps helped reduce confusion

##  Challenges

- Deciding what metrics are meaningful
- Keeping the tool simple and learning-focused

##  Next Steps

- Add recursive directory scanning
- Improve reporting format
- Explore AST-based analysis in future iterations
