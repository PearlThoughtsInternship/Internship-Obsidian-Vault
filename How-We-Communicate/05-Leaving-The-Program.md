# Leaving the Internship Program

## It's Okay to Leave

We understand that circumstances change. Whether due to personal reasons, other opportunities, or simply realizing this isn't the right fit — you can leave the internship program at any time.

**No judgment. No hard feelings.**

## How to Leave Gracefully

### Step 1: Notify HR

Send an email to **hr@pearlthoughts.com** with:

- Subject: **Internship Withdrawal - [Your Name]**
- Brief reason (optional, but helps us improve)
- Your last working day (can be immediate)
- Confirmation that you want to be removed from all communication channels

### Step 2: What Happens Next

After you notify HR:

1. **Teams Access** - We'll remove you from the Teams organization within 24-48 hours
2. **Email Lists** - You'll be unsubscribed from all internship-related emails
3. **GitHub Access** - Your repository access will be revoked
4. **No Further Communication** - You won't receive any messages from us

## Can I Remove Myself from Teams?

**Unfortunately, no.** Microsoft Teams doesn't allow guest users to remove themselves from an organization. You need to request removal through HR.

This is a Microsoft platform limitation, not our policy.

## What About My Work?

### Code Contributions
- Any code submitted via PR remains in the repository
- You retain credit as a contributor (commit history)

### Certificates
- If you've completed any milestones, you can request a partial completion certificate
- Contact HR to discuss options

### References
- Depending on your tenure and contributions, we may provide references
- Discuss with your mentor before leaving

## Returning in the Future

Leaving now doesn't mean the door is closed forever. If circumstances change, you're welcome to apply for future cohorts.
