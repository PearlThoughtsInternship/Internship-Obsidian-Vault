## How the Webinar Works

### You as an Attendee

By default, you join with:
- **Microphone**: Muted (controlled by hosts)
- **Camera**: Off
- **Screen sharing**: Disabled

This keeps the session manageable with 150+ people.

### When You Need to Present

If selected for demo or need to speak:
1. A mentor will enable your microphone
2. You can then share your screen
3. **Requirement**: You must be signed into Microsoft Teams (not just the webinar link)

→ If you're webinar-only without a Microsoft account, you cannot be promoted to presenter. See [[01-Teams-Getting-Started]].

---

## Demo Showcase: How It Works

### Weekly Selection
- Mentors identify **2-3 best contributions** from the previous week
- Selected interns are notified in advance
- ~5-7 minutes per demo

### What Makes a Good Demo
| Good | Not Good |
|------|----------|
| Working code with clear explanation | "I read the documentation" |
| Specific problem solved | Vague overview |
| Learnings and challenges shared | Only showing the result |
| Prepared and rehearsed | Figuring out what to show live |

### If You're Selected
1. Test your screen share before the session
2. Prepare a brief walkthrough (what, why, how)
3. Be ready to answer questions
4. Keep it under 7 minutes

---

## Community Feedback

### Hand-Raise Feature
- At the end of each session, you can raise your hand
- 3 people are randomly selected to share feedback or ask questions
- Keep it brief and relevant

### Chat Questions
- Post questions in the meeting chat throughout
- Mentors pick relevant/common questions to address
- **Tip**: Well-formed questions are more likely to be picked

---

## Participation Guidelines

### In the Chat

**Do:**
- Post questions (mentors will pick relevant ones)
- Share quick tips or resources
- Use reactions to support others' questions

**Don't:**
- Have extended back-and-forth conversations
- Post HR/admin queries (won't be addressed)
- Spam or send multiple rapid messages

### For Demos

**Do:**
- Prepare in advance
- Focus on what you learned
- Be concise

**Don't:**
- Wing it without preparation
- Go over your allotted time
- Get defensive about feedback

---

## Attendance

- Sessions are **mandatory** (see [[../Handbook/Policies-and-Guidelines|Policies]])
- Missing 3 consecutive sessions triggers review
- If you cannot attend, inform in advance via the appropriate channel

---

## Recording

Sessions may be recorded for:
- Interns who couldn't attend live
- Reference and learning
- Program documentation

Recordings (when available) are shared in the relevant Teams channel.

---

## Preparing for Your First Session

1. **Before**: Complete [[01-Teams-Getting-Started]] setup
2. **Join**: Click the webinar link 5 minutes early
3. **Listen**: First few sessions, observe how things work
4. **Participate**: Use chat to ask questions
5. **After**: Follow up on async discussions in Teams channels

## Technical Issues During Session

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Can't hear audio | Check volume, try refreshing |
| Video frozen | Refresh the page/app |
| Chat not working | Ensure you're signed in |
| Can't share screen when asked | You need full Microsoft Teams setup (not webinar-only) |

For persistent issues, post in the Support channel after the session.
