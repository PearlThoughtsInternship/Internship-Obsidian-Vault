## The Essentials

### Technical Questions → Teams Channels

All technical discussions happen in Microsoft Teams:
- Post questions in the appropriate channel
- Use threads to keep conversations organized
- Mentors respond during working hours

### Administrative Queries → HR Email

For anything related to your internship administration:

**Email**: HR@PearlThoughts.com

Topics for HR (not Teams):
- Internship certificates
- Appointment letters
- Stipend queries
- Leave requests
- Extension requests
- Reference letters

**Do not** post these in Teams channels — it clutters the technical space for everyone.

### Live Sessions → 10 AM Daily

Join the webinar for:
- Guidance and mentorship
- Demo showcases (2-3 best contributions weekly)
- Community feedback
- Q&A from chat

## Before You Begin

**Critical**: Many interns miss out on resources because they only join the webinar without proper Microsoft Teams setup.

→ Start with [[01-Teams-Getting-Started]] to ensure you have full access.
