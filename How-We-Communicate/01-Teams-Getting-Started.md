# Getting Started with Microsoft Teams

> **Read this carefully.** Many interns miss channels, materials, and collaboration opportunities because they skip this setup.

## Understanding Access Levels

There are two ways interns interact with our Teams environment:

| Access Level | What You Get | What You Miss |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Webinar-only** | Live 10 AM sessions, chat during meetings | Channels, materials, async discussions, file access |
| **Guest (Full Access)** | Everything above + all channels, files, async collaboration | Nothing |

**Goal**: You want **Guest** access. This is the highest privilege we offer to interns.

Your HR contact (Parvathi) can identify your access level by your icon in Teams. If you're webinar-only, follow the setup below.

## Setup: Getting Full Guest Access

### Step 1: Create a Microsoft Account

If you don't have one:

1. Go to [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com)
2. Click **Create a Microsoft account**
3. You can use your existing email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) or create a new one
4. Complete the verification process

**Common issues:**
- If your email is already linked to a Microsoft account you forgot about, use the "Forgot password" flow
- Some corporate emails may have restrictions — use a personal email if needed

### Step 2: Sign In to Microsoft Teams

1. Download [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-teams/download-app) (desktop recommended) or use the web version
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account
3. **Important**: Don't just join meetings — sign in to the Teams app itself

### Step 3: Accept the PearlThoughts Organization Invite

Once you've contacted HR and received an invite:

1. Check your email for an invite from PearlThoughts
2. Click the invite link
3. Sign in with your Microsoft account
4. You should now see the PearlThoughts organization in your Teams sidebar

### Step 4: Join the Internship Team

1. In the left sidebar, click **Teams**
2. Look for the **Internship** team (or your program-specific team)
3. If you don't see it, click **Join or create a team** and enter any code provided by HR
4. You should now see all channels

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I can join the 10 AM meeting but don't see any channels"

**Cause**: You're joining the webinar link directly without being signed into Teams or without Guest access.

**Fix**:
1. Ensure you're signed into Microsoft Teams (not just opening a meeting link)
2. Contact HR@PearlThoughts.com to confirm your Guest invite was sent
3. Check your email (including spam) for the organization invite

### "I can't present or share my screen in the 10 AM session"

**Cause**: Webinar attendees without Microsoft accounts cannot be given presenter rights.

**Fix**:
1. Complete the Microsoft account setup above
2. Sign in to Teams before joining the meeting
3. Mentors can then promote you to presenter when needed

### "I signed up but can't find the PearlThoughts team"

**Fix**:
1. In Teams, click the **Teams** icon in the left sidebar
2. If you see "You don't have any teams yet" — your Guest invite may not be processed
3. Email HR@PearlThoughts.com with your Microsoft account email to request the invite

### "My audio/video doesn't work in meetings"

**Fix**:
1. Check browser permissions (if using web Teams)
2. In Teams settings → Devices, verify your microphone and camera are selected
3. Try the desktop app if the web version has issues
4. Test with a colleague before the 10 AM session

### "I'm getting errors when signing up with my email"

**Possible causes**:
- Your email may already be linked to a Microsoft account
- Your organization (if corporate email) may block Microsoft account creation

**Fix**:
- Try "Forgot password" to recover an existing account
- Use a personal Gmail/Outlook email instead

## After Setup: What You Should See

Once properly set up as a Guest, you should have access to:

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| **Channels** | Left sidebar → Teams → Internship → (multiple channels) |
| **Files** | Each channel has a Files tab with shared materials |
| **Posts** | Async discussions in each channel |
| **Chat** | Direct messages with mentors and peers |
| **Calendar** | Scheduled sessions and meetings |

---

## Still Having Issues?

1. **First**: Re-read this guide and verify each step
2. **Then**: Post in the Support channel (if you have access)
3. **Or**: Email HR@PearlThoughts.com with:
   - Your name
   - Your Microsoft account email
   - Screenshot of what you see (or don't see)
   - What you've already tried
