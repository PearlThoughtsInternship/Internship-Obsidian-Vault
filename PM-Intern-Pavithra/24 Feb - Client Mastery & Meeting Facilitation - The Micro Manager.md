# 1. Escalation Email:

**SUBJECT**: Schedula Client - Decision Making Bottleneck

**BACKGROUND**: The client is repeatedly questioning the finalized choices of the Sprint 2 UI Color and the 30 min time slots. This is creating a re-justification of the work which is already done.

**IMPACT**: We are losing 5 hours a week for extra documentation which will cause 2 days delay to start the Sprint 3.

**WHAT I'VE DONE**: I've created a Decision log to explain our choices.

**NEXT STEPS NEEDED**: I need your support to holding on finalized design decisions. This will allow the team to stay focused and prevent costly rework that was not included in the original budget.

# 2. De-Escalation Script:

I understand this is urgent for your business to get the look and feel of the Schedula exactly right for your users. 
Let's take 5 minutes to understand the impact of changing the slots from 30 to 15 minutes on our final launch date.
Here are 3 options to solve this: keep it as it is for now, pause work and redesign, do a quick user testing today.
What is the business outcome we're trying to achieve? Are we worried about user confusion or just personal preference.
I'll get back to you by 4pm with the final impact analysis on what we have discussed today.
