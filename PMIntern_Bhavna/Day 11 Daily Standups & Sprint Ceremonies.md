**Date:** 20/02/2026

1 . Retrospective Overview

The purpose of this Sprint 2 retrospective is to reflect on team performance, identify improvement areas, and define actionable steps to enhance efficiency and collaboration in Sprint 3.

This retrospective focuses on structured process improvement rather than individual performance evaluation.

2 . Start / Stop / Continue Board

### START

- Writing clear and measurable acceptance criteria before moving any user story to “In Progress.”
    
- Sharing finalized design files at least one day before development begins.


### STOP

- Starting development without confirming requirements and scope alignment with the client.
    
- Discussing detailed technical solutions during daily standups.
  
  
  ### CONTINUE

- Conducting daily standups at 9:00 AM to maintain consistency and team alignment.
    
- Logging bugs in Jira with clear descriptions, reproduction steps, and priority levels.
  
3 .  Key Insights from Sprint 2

- Lack of clearly defined acceptance criteria led to confusion and minor rework.
    
- Requirement clarifications during development caused delays.
    
- Daily standups were effective but occasionally exceeded time due to deep solution discussions.
    
- Proper bug tracking improved transparency and accountability across the team.



## 4. Action Item for Sprint 3

### Selected Improvement

All user stories must include clearly defined acceptance criteria before being moved to “In Progress.”

### Why This Will Improve the Team

- Reduces ambiguity for developers.
    
- Minimizes rework and requirement misinterpretation.
    
- Provides clarity for QA during testing.
    
- Improves overall sprint predictability and delivery confidence.
    

### Owner

Project Manager – Responsible for reviewing and confirming acceptance criteria before sprint execution.

## 5. Expected Impact in Sprint 3

- Improved development efficiency.
    
- Reduced back-and-forth clarification cycles.
    
- Better coordination between Development, QA, and Design.
    
- Higher quality deliverables at sprint end.

## Conclusion

The Sprint 2 retrospective highlighted both strengths and improvement areas within the team’s workflow. By implementing structured acceptance criteria before development begins, Sprint 3 is expected to be more organized, predictable, and execution-focused.
