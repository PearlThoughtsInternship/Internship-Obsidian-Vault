**Goal:** Help interns influence teams and clients without authority

## 1. Session Start (3 Minutes)

**Read this exactly:**

> “PMs have no direct power over developers, designers, or clients. You can't say ‘Do this now!’
> 
> Today you'll learn how to get people to help you by:  
> • Talking to different teams (developers, marketing, sales)  
> • Getting agreement when everyone wants different things
> 
> We'll use Schedula examples — imagine launch is 2 weeks away.”

## 2. Talking to 5 Different Teams (20 Minutes)

### 2.1 PMs Are Translators

Explain:

> “Imagine you're in the middle. 5 people talking to you at once:
> 
> Developers: ‘We found a bug in payments’  
> Client: ‘When will booking be ready?’  
> Marketing: ‘We need demo screenshots today!’  
> Support: ‘This design confuses customers’  
> Sales: ‘Client wants WhatsApp NOW’
> 
> Your job: Translate so everyone understands each other.”

**Key Lesson:**  
PM = Translator + Prioritizer

### 2.2 Schedula Example – Launch Week

**Situation (Show This):**

Monday 10 AM chaos:

- Marketing: “Press release needs screenshots by 2 PM!”
    
- Sales: “Client demo tomorrow — everything must work!”
    
- Tech: “Payment bug blocks all testing”
    
- Support: “No training docs for receptionists”
    
- You (PM): ?
    

### What YOU Say (Read This Script)

> “Okay team, 2-minute sync.
> 
> **BIG PICTURE:** Client demo tomorrow = most important.
> 
> PRIORITY 1: Tech — fix payment bug first (blocks everything).  
> PRIORITY 2: Support — send training doc draft by 12 PM.  
> PRIORITY 3: Marketing — use current screenshots, I’ll get new ones after bug fix.  
> PRIORITY 4: Sales — demo will have booking + calendar (no payments yet).
> 
> Everyone clear on their #1 task for next 2 hours?”

### Why This Works

- One clear priority list
    
- Everyone knows exactly what to do
    
- Calm tone
    
- No blaming
    
- No bossy behavior

## 3. Getting Agreement When Everyone Wants Different Things (20 Minutes)

### 3.1 The Problem

Different demands:

- Marketing: “Launch March 15!”
    
- Tech: “Not possible till March 25”
    
- Client: “I want WhatsApp too!”
    
- Budget: “No extra money”
    
- You (PM): ?

### 3.2 Simple 4-Step Agreement Method

#### Step 1: Ask What They Want

> “What is most important for your goal?”

#### Step 2: Explain Limits (Use Numbers)

> “March 15 means only booking + calendar. WhatsApp adds 2 weeks.”

#### Step 3: Give 3 Choices

Choice A: March 15 (basic features)  
Choice B: March 25 (full features)  
Choice C: March 15 basic + WhatsApp later

#### Step 4: Let Them Pick

> “Which choice works best for you?”

**Why this works:**  
People feel involved in the decision.

### 3.3 Schedula Examples

#### Example 1 – Marketing Launch Date

Marketing: “March 15 launch!”  
You: “What if March 15 has booking + calendar only?”  
Marketing: “OK, but can we announce ‘full launch coming soon’?”  
✅ Agreement reached.

#### Example 2 – Client Wants Extra Feature

Client: “Add WhatsApp!”  
You: “WhatsApp takes 10 days. Launch is 6 days away.”

Choices:

1. WhatsApp now → launch delayed 4 days
    
2. WhatsApp next month → launch on time
    
3. Skip monthly reports → add WhatsApp on time
    

Client picks #2.  
✅ Agreement without conflict.


## 4. Quick Practice Activity (12 Minutes)

### Scenario: Schedula Launch Fight

- Sales: “Client demo tomorrow — full features!”
    
- Marketing: “Blog post needs screenshots TODAY!”
    
- Tech: “Database fix blocks everything till 6 PM!”
    
- Support: “No receptionist training!”

### Intern Task (5 Minutes Writing)

Write:

1. Your first sentence (calm the group)
    
2. Priority list (1 = most urgent)
    
3. What you tell each person

### Example Answer

**First Sentence:**  
“Team — 2 minutes to get aligned for client demo.”

**Priority List:**

1. Tech database fix
    
2. Sales demo prep
    
3. Support training
    
4. Marketing screenshots
    

**Communication:**

- Tech: “Database first — blocks everything.”
    
- Sales: “Demo booking + calendar only.”
    
- Support: “Send training draft by 2 PM.”
    
- Marketing: “Use old screenshots today.”

## 5. Your Real Job (Jira Task) – 2 Minutes

**Task:** SCH-95 “Schedula Priority List”  
**Due:** Tomorrow

### Instructions:

1. Open Schedula Sprint 3 Board
    
2. List Top 5 Tasks for This Week
    
3. Rank 1–5 (most urgent first)
    
4. For each task mention:
    
    - Owner
        
    - Deadline
        
5. Post priority list in Slack

### Why This Helps

PMs spend 50% of time getting agreement on “what matters most.”  
Clear priorities = Less stress + Faster execution.
