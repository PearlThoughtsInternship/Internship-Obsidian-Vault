**Focus:** Running Discovery Workshops & Requirement Sessions

# 1. Session Kickoff 

### Read Aloud:

> "Yesterday we learned how to handle difficult clients. Today we learn how to prevent those situations by running great meetings.
> 
> We’ll cover:
> 
> - Discovery workshops – Getting clear requirements at project start
>     
> - Requirement sessions – Refining scope mid-project
>     
> - Facilitation techniques – Keeping groups productive
>     
> - Your first workshop – Live Schedula feature prioritization
>     
> 
> Great PMs don’t just react to problems; they prevent confusion through structured conversations."


# 2. Why Workshops Replace Endless Emails 

## 2.1 The Problem with Email / Async Communication

### Scenario Example

**Email Chain (5 Days):**

Day 1: “What features for Schedula?”  
Day 2: “Booking, calendar, reminders.”  
Day 3: “Also payments?”  
Day 4: “What about staff scheduling?”  
Day 5: “Monthly reports too?”

**Result:**  
5 days wasted. Still no clarity. No priorities. No ownership.

### Workshop Advantage

**1-hour workshop → Clear priority list → Everyone aligned → Faster execution**

Instead of scattered communication, structured workshops:

- Clarify expectations
    
- Define scope
    
- Align stakeholders
    
- Prevent rework

## 2.2 When to Run Workshops

Run workshops in 3 key situations:

### 1️. Project Kickoff

Question: “What are we building?”

### 2️ .Mid-Project Scope Review

Question: “What stays? What goes?”

### 3️. Problem-Solving

Question: “Why are we delayed? How do we fix it?”

## Schedula Example (Week 2 Workshop Decision)

**Must Have (MVP):**

- Booking
    
- Calendar
    
- SMS Reminders
    

**Should Have:**

- Staff Scheduling
    

**Could Have:**

- Monthly Reports
    

**Won’t Have (Phase 2):**

- Payments
    
- Google Sync
    

This clarity saved development time and prevented scope creep.

# 3. The 60-Minute Workshop Framework (20 Minutes)

This is your **exact repeatable structure**.

## WORKSHOP TEMPLATE

**Topic:** Feature Prioritization – Schedula  
**Date/Time:** [Add Details]  
**Facilitator:** [Your Name]  
**Objective:** Agree on MVP Features

## Agenda Breakdown

### 0–5 Minutes: Welcome + Ground Rules

Say:

- One person speaks at a time
    
- No idea is wrong
    
- We focus on MVP (not dream version)
    
- Stay solution-oriented

### 5–15 Minutes: Context Setting (5–10 min Talk)

Explain:

- Current project stage
    
- Timeline
    
- Budget limitations
    
- Business goal
    

Example:

> “We have 6 weeks. We cannot build everything. Today we decide what goes in Phase 1.”


### 15–25 Minutes: Silent Brainstorm

Everyone writes features silently (no discussion).

Why?

- Prevents loud voices dominating
    
- Encourages introverts
    
- More structured thinking

### 25–35 Minutes: Group Sharing (Round Robin)

Each person shares 1 idea at a time.

Facilitator writes all features on board.

No debate yet.

### 35–50 Minutes: Prioritization

Use **MoSCoW Method:**

- Must
    
- Should
    
- Could
    
- Won’t
    

Discuss briefly and assign category.

Focus questions:

- Is this critical for launch?
    
- Can we survive without it?
    
- Does it impact revenue?

### 50–55 Minutes: Final Alignment

Read final list aloud.

Ask:

> “Does everyone agree this is our MVP scope?”

Get verbal confirmation.

### 55–60 Minutes: Action Items

Assign:

- Who documents outcomes?
    
- Who updates Jira?
    
- Who informs stakeholders?
    

Meeting ends with clarity.

# 4. Facilitation Techniques Every PM Must Use (10 Minutes)

## 1️. Parking Lot Method

If discussion goes off-topic:

- Write it in “Parking Lot”
    
- Address later
    

Prevents time waste.


## 2️ . Time Boxing

Every discussion has fixed time.  
Example:

- Feature debate = 3 minutes max.

## 3️.  Neutral Facilitation

As PM:

- Don’t push personal opinion
    
- Guide discussion
    
- Ask clarifying questions
    

You manage the process, not the solution.

# 5. Live Exercise – Schedula Feature Prioritization (10 Minutes)

### Activity:

Divide group into teams.

Each team gets:

Features:

- Booking
    
- Calendar
    
- SMS
    
- Payments
    
- Staff scheduling
    
- Reports
    
- Google sync
    
- Discount codes
    
- Admin dashboard
    

Task:  
Prioritize using MoSCoW in 5 minutes.

Then discuss differences.
