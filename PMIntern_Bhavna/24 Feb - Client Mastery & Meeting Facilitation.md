**Level:** Advanced Client & Facilitation Skills

# 1. Session Objective

This session focuses on developing advanced client management and meeting facilitation skills required to transition from a task executor to a trusted project advisor.

By the end of the session, interns will be able to:

- Identify different types of difficult clients
    
- Use de-escalation language effectively
    
- Apply structured escalation paths
    
- Facilitate focused, decision-driven meetings
    
- Use simple prioritization and workshop techniques

# 2. Session Context (Schedula Project)

We are in **Week 7 of 10** of the Schedula project (Salon Booking App).

The client has raised three additional feature requests and has threatened to look at other vendors if all requested features are not delivered before launch.

This scenario forms the base for practical learning.

# 3. Handling Difficult Clients & Escalations (25 Minutes)

## 3.1 Four Types of Difficult Clients

| Client Type      | Behavior                      | Example                                        | PM Strategy                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| The Demander     | Urgent, aggressive tone       | "Add WhatsApp NOW or we're switching vendors." | Slow down conversation, gather facts    |
| The Scope Creep  | Keeps adding “small” requests | "Also add coupons, Google sync…"               | Use Iron Triangle (Scope–Time–Cost)     |
| The Radio Silent | No responses or feedback      | No design approval for 10 days                 | Escalate politely, propose alternatives |
| The Micromanager | Questions every decision      | "Why blue? Why 30 min slots?"                  | Proactive communication & documentation |
### Key Learning:

Difficult clients are not “bad” clients. They are usually stressed business owners. The PM’s job is to create clarity.

## 3.2 De-escalation Language Framework

### What To Say:

- “I understand this is important for your business.”
    
- “Let’s quickly assess the impact.”
    
- “Here are 2–3 options we can consider.”
    
- “What business outcome are you trying to achieve?”
    
- “I will get back to you by [specific time].”
    

### What Not To Say:

- “Calm down.”
    
- “That’s impossible.”
    
- “We’ll try our best.”
    
- “That’s not in scope.”
    

### De-escalation Formula:

Acknowledge → Assess Facts → Provide Options → Confirm Timeline

## 3.3 Escalation Path

### Ownership Rule:

PM owns decisions up to:

- ₹50,000 budget impact
    
- 2-day delay
    

Escalate anything larger.

### Escalation Email Template

**Subject:** [Client Name] Escalation – [Issue Summary]

**Background:**  
[2 sentences summarizing issue]

**Impact:**  
[Timeline / Budget / Quality Risk]

**What I’ve Done:**  
[Steps taken to resolve]

**Next Steps Needed:**  
[Decision required from leadership]


### Schedula Example

**Subject:** Salon Owner Escalation – WhatsApp Feature

**Background:**  
Client demands WhatsApp booking integration before launch (6 days remaining).

**Impact:**  
+2 weeks delay OR +₹1.5L cost OR removal of 2 existing features.

**What I’ve Done:**  
Presented 3 options; client insists on full inclusion before launch.

**Next Steps Needed:**  
Leadership decision on commercial and launch priority.

# 4. Meeting Facilitation Framework (25 Minutes)

## 4.1 Why Meetings Fail

Common issues:

- No agenda
    
- No time discipline
    
- No clear decisions
    

Result: Time waste and confusion.

## 4.2 The 7-Minute Meeting Framework

A structured micro-meeting format:

1 Minute – Agenda & Objective  
“Today we will decide [specific outcome].”

2 Minutes – Time-boxed Discussion  
Each person shares input briefly.

2 Minutes – Options  
Present 2–3 possible solutions.

2 Minutes – Decision  
Confirm decision and assign ownership.

### Key Principle:

Meetings are for decisions, not endless discussions.

## 4.3 Facilitation Activities (Schedula Examples)

### 1. Silent Brainstorming

Participants write ideas individually for 3 minutes without discussion.  
Use Case: Feature ideation.

### 2. Dot Voting

Each participant receives 3 votes to prioritize ideas.  
Use Case: Selecting top 3 features.

### 3. 5-5-5 Prioritization

5 min discussion → 5 min voting → 5 min decision.  
Use Case: Finalizing MVP scope.

### 4. Parking Lot

Off-topic items are written separately and addressed after main agenda.  
Prevents meeting derailment.

# 5. Live Exercise: Difficult Client Role-Play (10 Minutes)

## Scenario: The WhatsApp Ultimatum

Client Statement:

“I pay ₹8 lakhs. My competitors have WhatsApp booking. If you can’t add it before launch, I’ll find someone who can.”

## Model PM Response:

“Thank you for being direct. I understand WhatsApp is important for your business. Let me quickly assess impact:

- Development: 10 days
    
- Testing: 3 days
    
- Total delay: 2 weeks
    

We have 3 options:

1. Add WhatsApp and delay launch by 2 weeks
    
2. Launch on time and include WhatsApp in Phase 2
    
3. Add WhatsApp and remove Monthly Reports feature
    

Which option aligns best with your launch goals? I will confirm internally and revert by 2 PM today.”
