# Day 10 — Change Management & Scope

Yesterday’s session was about **how a Project Manager handles change requests without letting the project go out of control**.

The main concept we learned is **Scope Creep**.

---

## 1) What is Scope Creep?

Scope creep means:

> Project requirements keep increasing without increasing time, cost, or team.

It does **not happen suddenly**.  
It happens slowly through “small requests”.

Example in Schedula:

- Change button color → small
    
- Add photos → small
    
- Add WhatsApp booking → medium
    
- Add loyalty system → big
    

Individually they look harmless, but together they caused **3+ weeks delay**.

So the danger is:  
**Projects don’t fail because of one big mistake — they fail because of many small uncontrolled changes.**

Common reasons:

- “While you’re at it…”
    
- Client keeps adding features
    
- Unclear requirements
    
- Developers adding extra features
    

---

## 2) The 5-Step Change Control Process (Most Important Part)

Whenever a client asks for a new feature, a PM should NOT immediately say yes or no.  
Instead, follow a professional process:

### Step 1 — Log the request

Write it formally:  
who asked, what feature, date, priority.

This makes it official.

---

### Step 2 — Impact Assessment

We check how the change affects:

• Scope (more work)  
• Time (delay)  
• Cost (budget increase)

Example:  
WhatsApp Integration:

- +5 story points
    
- +7 days
    
- +₹30,000
    

Now the discussion becomes **data-based**, not emotional.

---

### Step 3 — Generate Options

A PM never says only “Yes” or “No”.

Always give **3 choices**.

Example:

1. Add feature and delay launch
    
2. Add in next release
    
3. Replace another feature
    

This makes the client part of the decision.

---

### Step 4 — Present Trade-offs (Iron Triangle)

Every project has 3 constraints:  
**Scope – Time – Cost**

You can only optimize two.

So if client wants a new feature:

- Either delay timeline
    
- Or increase budget
    
- Or remove another feature
    

The PM’s job is to **show this clearly**, not argue.

---

### Step 5 — Document the Decision

After the client chooses:

- Record it
    
- Update roadmap
    
- Inform team
    

This protects the project and the PM.

---

## 3) Preventing Scope Creep

Best solution is prevention.

We prevent it by:

- Clear requirements
    
- Written user stories
    
- Defined “out of scope” list
    
- Regular demos
    
- Stakeholder communication
    

Example (Schedula MVP):  
Not included in launch:

- Payments
    
- Loyalty points
    
- WhatsApp booking
    
- Mobile app
    

If listed earlier → fewer conflicts later.

---

## 4) Saying “No” Professionally

Bad PM:

> “No, not in scope.”

Good PM:

> “That’s a good idea. To add it we need to adjust timeline, scope, or budget. Let me show you options.”

So a PM doesn’t reject —  
a PM **facilitates a decision**.

---

## 5) Key Takeaways

- Scope creep is a silent project killer.
    
- Every change must follow a formal process.
    
- Always present options, not yes/no.
    
- Use data and trade-offs to communicate.
    
- Document every decision.
    
- Prevention is better than firefighting.
