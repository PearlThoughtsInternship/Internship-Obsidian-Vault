### Start / Stop / Continue (Schedula – Sprint 2 Retrospective)

**START:**

- Create a clear “Definition of Done” checklist for every Jira story (AC met, QA passed, updated on staging).
- Do a 10-minute daily “staging health check” (DevOps + QA) before standup so environment issues are caught early.

**STOP:**

- Starting development on tickets that do not have acceptance criteria or designs linked (causes rework and delays).
- Reporting blockers late (waiting until end of day). Blockers must be raised in standup or immediately in the team channel.

**CONTINUE:**

- Walking the Jira board in standup (Done → In Progress → To Do) and keeping standup under 15 minutes.
- Logging bugs in Jira with steps to reproduce and screenshots (helps dev fix faster).

### Action Item for Sprint 3

**ACTION ITEM FOR SPRINT 3:**

- **What will change:** Make “Acceptance Criteria + DoD(Definition of Done) checklist” mandatory before moving any story into In Progress (PM ensures AC exists; Dev/QA confirm DoD items).
- **Why this helps:** It prevents unclear requirements, reduces rework, and makes sprint delivery more predictable because everyone agrees what “done” means before work starts.
- **Who owns it:** PM (you) owns the checklist and enforces the rule. Dev lead supports compliance. QA lead validates DoD items before moving to Done.
