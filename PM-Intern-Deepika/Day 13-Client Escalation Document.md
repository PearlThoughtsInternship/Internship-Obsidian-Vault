**Client Type: Demander**

**The Situation:**

Your client is a **mid-size dermatology clinic chain** that recently signed a yearly contract and just onboarded 3 branches.

It’s **Monday morning (10:15 AM)**.

You receive this message from the clinic owner on WhatsApp (not even email):

> “Patients are missing appointments. We NEED WhatsApp reminders immediately.  
> Add WhatsApp reminders TODAY or we will stop onboarding the remaining branches and reconsider the contract.”

Important background:

- WhatsApp reminder feature is **not built yet** (only SMS + Email reminders exist).
    
- Building WhatsApp integration requires:
    
    - Meta/WhatsApp Business API approval (3–10 days)
        
    - Backend development (~1 week)
        
    - Testing (~3–4 days)
        
- Your engineering team is currently in the middle of a **release freeze** for another hospital deployment.
    
- Sales team had verbally hinted “WhatsApp may come soon” but **it is not in the signed scope**.
    
- The client is one of the **largest potential revenue accounts** in your region.
    
- The clinic has already complained once about patient no-shows.
    

5 minutes later, you get another message:

> “I am serious. I have a meeting with another vendor at 4 PM.”

You now need to handle the situation.

**Proposed Solutions:**

1. **Escalation Email** to your PM lead (use template above)

	Hi [PM Lead Name],

	**BACKGROUND:**  
		Our dermatology clinic client is facing many missed patient appointments and is requesting WhatsApp reminders immediately. They have also mentioned they are evaluating another vendor today if we cannot support this.
	
	**IMPACT:**  
		This is a high-value client currently live with 3 branches and planning to onboard more. There is a risk of onboarding pause or churn if we cannot provide confidence in a solution.
	
	WhatsApp feature is not currently available.
	
	Estimated effort:
	
	- Meta/WhatsApp Business API approval: 3–10 days
	    
	- Backend development: ~1 week
	    
	- Testing & rollout: ~3–4 days  
	    Engineering team is also in release freeze for another hospital deployment.
	    
	
	**WHAT I’VE DONE:**  
		I acknowledged their business issue and did not commit to same-day delivery. I informed them we are reviewing internally and scheduled a follow-up discussion today. I also explored a temporary workaround using improved SMS reminders.
	
	**NEXT STEPS NEEDED:**  
	Please confirm how we want to proceed:
	
	1. Fast-track WhatsApp integration as a priority retention case  
	    OR
	    
	2. Keep roadmap priority and position this as a future enhancement
	    
	
	I need your guidance before my follow-up call with the client.
	
	Thanks,  
	Deepika

2.  **De-escalation Script** (what you say to client first)

	“I understand this is urgent. Missed appointments directly affect your clinic, so I take this seriously. Before I suggest a solution, I want to understand properly — are most missed patients new patients or follow-ups?”
	
	**Let them speak first.**
	
	“Thank you for explaining. I don’t want to give you a quick promise and then fail later. I am checking what we can do immediately and what we can improve permanently. I will come back to you today with a clear plan and timeline.

	Let’s connect once today so you have clarity before your vendor meeting.”
	
3. 1. **Meeting Agenda** (7-minute framework for follow-up)
	
### Goal

> “Today we will decide what immediate action we take to reduce missed appointments and also the plan for WhatsApp reminders.”

---

### Confirm the problem

> “From our discussion, missed appointments are affecting your clinic operations.  
> Reducing no-shows this week is the main priority, correct?”

(Wait for them to say yes.)

---

### 2 Give options

> “We have two options:
> 
> **Option 1:** We immediately improve SMS reminders and add an extra reminder. This can start right away.
> 
> **Option 2:** We start WhatsApp integration. This is permanent but will need some setup and approval time.”

---

### 2 Decision

> “Which option would you like us to start first?  
> Based on your decision, I will begin the process today and share the timeline by evening.”

Then close:

> “I will personally track this and keep you updated so you don’t have to follow up.”


# Summary of Whole Document

- PM’s real job is **managing people**, not just managing tasks.
    
- Two core skills: **handle difficult clients** + **run clear meetings**.
    

---

### Difficult Clients

- 4 types: Demander, Scope creep, Radio silent, Micromanager.
    
- First calm the client → don’t argue or say “not in scope”.
    
- Use this flow:  
    **Acknowledge → Understand problem → Give options → Commit follow-up time**
    
- Give **choices**, not explanations.
    
- Escalate when impact is big (money, delay, or churn risk).
    

---

### Escalation

- You handle small issues yourself.
    
- Bigger risk → inform leadership using structured email:
    
    - What happened
        
    - Business impact
        
    - What I tried
        
    - What decision they need
        

---

### Meetings

- Most meetings fail because: no agenda, no time control, no decision.
    
- Always run a **time-boxed meeting**.
    

**7-minute structure:**

1. State goal
    
2. Quick discussion
    
3. Present options
    
4. Take decision + owner
