## Day 13 — Getting Work Done Without Authority 

This session teaches that a Product Manager doesn’t control anyone directly.  
PMs cannot order developers, designers, sales, or clients.  
Instead, a PM’s real skill is **influence and coordination**.

### 1. PM is basically a translator

A PM stands in the middle of many teams:

- Developers talk technical problems
    
- Clients ask timelines
    
- Marketing wants promotion material
    
- Support worries about users
    
- Sales wants more features
    

The PM’s job is to **align everyone and set clear priorities** so all teams know what to do first.

Instead of confusion, the PM says:

- what is most important
    
- who will do what
    
- what can wait
    

A clear priority list solves most conflicts.

### 2. When everyone wants different things

Usually every stakeholder wants something different:

- Marketing wants early launch
    
- Tech needs more time
    
- Client wants extra features
    
- Budget wants less cost
    

The PM doesn’t argue.  
The PM guides the decision using a simple method:

**Step 1:** Ask their goal  
**Step 2:** Explain limitations with time/effort  
**Step 3:** Give 2–3 options  
**Step 4:** Let them choose

So instead of saying _no_, you say:  
“Here are the trade-offs — you decide.”

This makes people cooperate.

### 3. Why priorities matter

Most project problems happen because:  
**everyone thinks their work is most urgent.**

The PM fixes this by:

- calming the group
    
- listing tasks in order
    
- telling each team their next action
    

When priorities are clear, conflicts reduce.

### Final Lesson

A PM’s real power is not authority.  
It is:

- communication
    
- prioritization
    
- helping people agree
    

If a PM can get agreement on **what matters most**, the project moves forward smoothly.
